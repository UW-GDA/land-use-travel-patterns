## Short Summary
This study will provide insight into travel demand patterns and land use in Washington state. Points of interest (POI), such as transit stations, hospitals, parks, or grocery shops, will be used as a base variable

## Introductory/background information
Linking travel trajectories and POI locations may provide insight into mobility patterns which improve a person's overall accessibility. For example, individuals living in the suburbs may have fewer healthcare-related POIs near their home and thus have lower healthcare accessibility. However, as they commute downtown for work, we may observe spatiotemporal changes to healthcare POI density and subsequent increases in accessibility.

## Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s)
We aim to analyze correlations between travel pattern origin-destination (OD) flows and land use. Land uses will be identified via satellite imagery. The following questions will be answered:
1) How do land uses affect trip generation? In other words, what land uses are correlated with a greater number of trips (e.g., do residential areas have more trips than industrial areas)?
2) What is the correlation between OD flows and demographics given similar land uses? For example, do low-income census tracts have a greater number of outflows compared to high-income census tracts?


## Datasets
ORCA smartcard data (information on where individuals “tap-in” to a bus or light rail station), Google Place API, Yelp API

## Tools/packages you’ll use


## Methodology/approach
* Computer Vision for land use classification
* OD Flow Analysis

## Expected outcomes
* Clustering with OD flows and correlation with land use
* Classification of land use via satellite imagery(Image Classification)
* Map for demographics, OD flow map
