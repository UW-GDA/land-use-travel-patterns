## Short Summary
This study will provide insight into travel demand patterns and land use in the Puget Sound region. Land uses will be determined through satellite imagery and computer vision, while travel demand patterns will be extracted from a household travel survey. Demographic analysis will also be conducted.

## Introductory/background information
Linking travel trajectories and land uses may provide insight into mobility patterns which improve a person's overall accessibility. ~~For example, individuals living in the suburbs may have fewer healthcare-related POIs near their home and thus have lower healthcare accessibility. However, as they commute downtown for work, we may observe spatiotemporal changes to healthcare POI density and subsequent increases in accessibility.~~

## Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s)
We aim to analyze correlations between travel pattern origin-destination (OD) flows and land use. Land uses will be identified via satellite imagery. The following questions will be answered:
1) How do land uses affect trip generation? In other words, what land uses are correlated with a greater number of trips (e.g., do residential areas have more trips than industrial areas)?
2) What is the correlation between OD flows and demographics given similar land uses? For example, do low-income residential census tracts have a greater number of outflows compared to high-income residential census tracts?


## Datasets
* [Puget Sound Regional Council Household Travel Survey] (https://www.psrc.org/our-work/household-travel-survey-program): Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC), the metropolitan planning organization (MPO) for King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish counties, conducts a travel survey every 2-3 years to understand the travel patterns of its residents. This survey captures specific trips a person makes and records specific characteristics, such as travel time, origin location, destination location, and purpose of trip along with trip-maker characteristics. For this project, trip origins and destinations will be extracted to understand travel flows across the four-county region.

* American Community Survey
